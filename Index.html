            authentication and data protection. Encryption and privacy
            measures were integrated to safeguard personal health information.
            Challenges and Solutions: Transition from MERN to Django: Adapting
            to Django from the MERN stack presented a learning curve. I
            embraced this challenge by leveraging Django’s comprehensive
            documentation and resources, successfully applying my skills to
            build a functional and reliable application. User Experience
            Design: Creating an engaging user interface with Django’s
            templating system required careful design and testing. I focused
            on ensuring a user-friendly experience, with clear navigation and
            interactive elements.
